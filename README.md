# ArchInstall-Beta
## IMPORTANT
You WILL have to edit the code to suit your drive, in order to get the correct drive directory. This is pretty basic, so if you don't know how to do this, Arch Linux is not the way to go.
## Why choose this over the normal 'archinstall' that comes with the ISO?
'archinstall' is pretty user-friendly, but as does require a minimal amount of manual input, for some people this is not ideal. This script solves the issue.

## ALSO IMPORTANT
As this project is open-source, users who have the time and want to contribute to this project, they can create modifications to the code and submit a pull request. If you have any Suggestions or Bugs, please submit them on the BUG tab.
